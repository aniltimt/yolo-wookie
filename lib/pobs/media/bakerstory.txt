When I was a kid, my sisters and I would love to help my mom make chocolate chip cookies.
One night, we decided to make some. She put everything in the big mixer and turned it on.
Of course being curious at that age i had to look in. Well that was a big mistake combined with the fact that i had very long hair.
My hair got caught in the mixer while it was going around and around! We had to stop the mixer and untangle my hair from it.
The moral of the story? Tie up your hair when you cook.
